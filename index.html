            <p class="introduction">
                The <strong>Frameworkless Movement</strong> is a group of developers interested in developing applications without frameworks. <strong>We don't hate frameworks</strong>, nor we will ever create campaigns against frameworks, but we perceive the <strong>misuse of frameworks as a lack of knowledge regarding technical debt</strong> and the availability of alternatives given by the vanilla language or by dedicated libraries.
            </p>

            <h1>Why the Movement</h1>
            <p>
                Every time a team uses a framework, it also takes a <strong>risk</strong>. The risk is that after some time has passed the team ends up with a tool that does not provide any kind of value anymore and that most of the times represents a major roadblock to change. Most importantly a framework could "die" way before the software that uses it, leaving the developers with a heavy burden.
            </p>
            <p>
                This risk is amplified without the presence of a strong bond between technical decision making, business goals, and user experience. Instead, the non-functional requirements like deadline, lifespan, budget, usability, future business scenarios and domain-specific constraints should be the primary decision drivers for the architectural choices as well as for the implementation roadmap.
            </p>
            <h2>Is Frameworkless only for developers?</h2>
            <p>
                Because user research, design activities and business goals are those that more clarify the non-functional requirements we think it's important to put everyone who works on the project in our discussion, non-developers included. Every technical decision, including the choice of a framework, should be made considering every aspect of the context the software "lives".
            </p>
            <h2>Our purpose</h2>
            <p>
                We commit to learn and help others learn how to deliver software with a Frameworkless approach. We want to make everyone <strong>consider a "No Framework" as an option when choosing a technology</strong> for a new project or a new feature of an existing project. Finally, we want to help everybody make mindful technical decisions.
            </p>
            <h2>What Frameworkless Movement is</h2>
            <p>
                Like we stated above, <strong>we don't think that frameworks are evil</strong>. They are very powerful tools, written in plain vanilla language and in a very generic way, a fact that makes them great learning tools which can help anyone learn how to code <strong>without them</strong>. In order to know how and when you should use a particular framework you have to understand how frameworks work. Understanding the strengths and the constraints of each framework will enable you to make the right choice of a framework. Even more, it will be very clear when you don't need one at all. Grasping the concepts of how frameworks work behind the scenes will deepen your knowledge about the language itself. Knowing the framework's rationale will enable you to write better code for each specific problem you encounter.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nonetheless, we believe that a framework, when chosen, should be used responsibly throughout the life of the project. Continuously remind yourself that every tool has some kind of tradeoff.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworkless means that you must give the right importance to the technological decision making and realize that the choice to develop a project or a single feature with no dependence on a framework is a real possibility!
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworkless also means that you must take into account the entire context where the software will have to "be born" and "live". Including the developers' skills who have to develop the software, deciding if they can get help from a framework keeping in mind the reasons that support this choice and its tradeoffs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, Frameworkless means that you should not assume that writing software is a responsibility you can afford to delegate elsewhere and depend on other software (a library for example) to solve a specific problem you have. You can avoid binding hand and foot to a whole framework when you don't really need it.
            </p>
            <h2>What Frameworkless Movement is not</h2>
            <p>
                Frameworkless <strong>does not mean that we have to (or we want to) build our own framework</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworkless <strong>does not mean "reinvent the wheel"</strong>. There are a lot of "tools" (frameworks, libraries but also StackOverflow) that solve known and common problems in a great way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworkless <strong>does not mean that you must develop all software by yourself without a framework</strong> in every context and in every situation, thinking that this is more secure and more high-performance (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here#In_computing">Not Invented Here syndrome</a>), far from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Frameworkless is not a model where "everyone protects his own point of view" and acts in separate ways and times. Instead, we are in favor of making shared decisions, thinking about the good of the whole project.
            </p>
            <h2>Principles</h2>
            <p>These are a draft of the principles that guide us:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Our primary objective is to deliver quality software in reasonable time. If we can achieve this without frameworks, we prefer not to use them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We commit to study and understand the code of the framework we use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We also take into consideration non-functional requirements in order to choose a good framework.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We make explicit both reasons and tradeoffs behind every technical decision.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Our Manifesto</h2>
            <p>
                We are going to define and publish the Manifesto of the Movement. <strong>We want to create it sharing our ideas with other developers, so right now we're creating a distributed team to help us to create a good Manifesto</strong>. If you want to be part of this team please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@frameworklessmovement.org">info@frameworklessmovement.org</a>.
            </p>
